# GameOfLife
Python Script to the John Conway's GameOfLife

In the Game of Life each grid cell can have either one of two states: dead or alive. The Game of Life is controlled by four simple rules which are applied to each grid cell in the simulation domain:

1. A live cell dies if it has fewer than two live neighbors.
2. A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. A dead cell will be brought back to live if it has exactly three live neighbors.

To Place a cell, you choose a Column(A-T) and a Line(1-20), Ex: E5, and press Enter.
To Start the Simulation type "Done".
